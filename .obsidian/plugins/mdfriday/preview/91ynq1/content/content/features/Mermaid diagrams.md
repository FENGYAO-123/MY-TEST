Quartz supports Mermaid which allows you to add diagrams and charts to your notes. Mermaid supports a range of diagrams, such as [flow charts](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/flowchart.html), [sequence diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/sequenceDiagram.html), and [timelines](https://mermaid.js.org/syntax/timeline.html). This is enabled as a part of [[Obsidian compatibility]] and can be configured and enabled/disabled from that plugin.

By default, Quartz will render Mermaid diagrams to match the site theme.

> [!warning]
> Wondering why Mermaid diagrams may not be showing up even if you have them enabled? You may need to reorder your plugins so that [[ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown]] is _after_ [[SyntaxHighlighting]].

## Syntax

To add a Mermaid diagram, create a mermaid code block.

````
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```
````

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```

## Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it?}
    B -->|Yes| C[OK]
    C --> D[Rethink]
    D --> B
    B ---->|No| E[End]
```

## Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```

## Class Diagram

```mermaid
classDiagram
    Animal <|-- Duck
    Animal <|-- Fish
    Animal <|-- Zebra
    Animal : +int age
    Animal : +String gender
    Animal: +isMammal()
    Animal: +mate()
    class Duck{
        +String beakColor
        +swim()
        +quack()
    }
    class Fish{
        -int sizeInFeet
        -canEat()
    }
    class Zebra{
        +bool is_wild
        +run()
    }
```

## State Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Still
    Still --> [*]
    Still --> Moving
    Moving --> Still
    Moving --> Crash
    Crash --> [*]
```

## Regular code block (should not be rendered)

```javascript
const x = 1;
const y = 2;
console.log(x + y);
```

## Inline code should also not be affected

This is `code` and this is more `code with $math$` but not mermaid.
