It supports nested folders and is highly customizable.\n\nBy default, it shows all folders and files on your page. To display the explorer in a different spot, you can edit the [[layout]].\n\nDisplay names for folders get determined by the `title` frontmatter field in `folder/index.md` (more detail in [[authoring content | Authoring Content]]). If this file does not exist or does not contain frontmatter, the local folder name will be used instead.\n\n> [!info]\n> The explorer uses local storage by default to save the state of your explorer.

You can disable this by passing `useSavedState: false` as an argument.\n\n## Customization\n\nMost configuration can be done by passing in options to `Component.Explorer()`.\n\nFor example, here's what the default configuration looks like:\n\n```typescript title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  title: \"Explorer\", // title of the explorer component\n  folderClickBehavior: \"collapse\", // what happens when you click a folder (\"link\" to navigate to folder page on click or \"collapse\" to collapse folder on click)\n  folderDefaultState: \"collapsed\", // default state of folders (\"collapsed\" or \"open\")\n  useSavedState: true, // whether to use local storage to save \"state\" (which folders are opened) of explorer\n  // omitted but shown later\n  sortFn: ...,\n  filterFn: ...,\n  mapFn: ...,\n  // what order to apply functions in\n  order: [\"filter\", \"map\", \"sort\"],\n})\n```\n\nWhen passing in your own options, you can omit any or all of these fields if you'd like to keep the default value for that field.\n\nWant to customize it even more?\n\n- Removing explorer: remove `Component.Explorer()` from `quartz.layout.ts`\n  - (optional): After removing the explorer component, you can move the [[table of contents | Table of Contents]] component back to the `left` part of the layout\n- Changing `sort`, `filter` and `map` behavior: explained in [[#Advanced customization]]\n- Component: `quartz/components/Explorer.tsx`\n- Style: `quartz/components/styles/explorer.scss`\n- Script: `quartz/components/scripts/explorer.inline.ts`\n\n## Advanced customization\n\nThis component allows you to fully customize all of its behavior. You can pass a custom `sort`, `filter` and `map` function.\nAll functions you can pass work with the `FileTrieNode` class, which has the following properties:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/components/Explorer.tsx\"\nclass FileTrieNode {\n  isFolder: boolean\n  children: Array<FileTrieNode>\n  data: ContentDetails | null\n}\n```\n\n```ts title=\"quartz/plugins/emitters/contentIndex.tsx\"\nexport type ContentDetails = {\n  slug: FullSlug\n  title: string\n  links: SimpleSlug[]\n  tags: string[]\n  content: string\n}\n```\n\nEvery function you can pass is optional. By default, only a `sort` function will be used:\n\n```ts title=\"Default sort function\"\n// Sort order: folders first, then files. Sort folders and files alphabetically\nComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) => {\n    if ((!a.isFolder && !b.isFolder) || (a.isFolder && b.isFolder)) {\n      return a.displayName.localeCompare(b.displayName, undefined, {\n        numeric: true,\n        sensitivity: \"base\",\n      })\n    }\n\n    if (!a.isFolder && b.isFolder) {\n      return 1\n    } else {\n      return -1\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n\n---\n\nYou can pass your own functions for `sortFn`, `filterFn` and `mapFn`. All functions will be executed in the order provided by the `order` option (see [[#Customization]]). These functions behave similarly to their `Array.prototype` counterpart, except they modify the entire `FileNode` tree in place instead of returning a new one.\n\nFor more information on how to use `sort`, `filter` and `map`, you can check [Array.prototype.sort()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort), [Array.prototype.filter()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and [Array.prototype.map()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).\n\nType definitions look like this:\n\n```ts\ntype SortFn = (a: FileTrieNode, b: FileTrieNode) => number\ntype FilterFn = (node: FileTrieNode) => boolean\ntype MapFn = (node: FileTrieNode) => void\n```\n\n## Basic examples\n\nThese examples show the basic usage of `sort`, `map` and `filter`.\n\n### Use `sort` to put files first\n\nUsing this example, the explorer will alphabetically sort everything.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  sortFn: (a, b) => {\n    return a.displayName.localeCompare(b.displayName)\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Change display names (`map`)\n\nUsing this example, the display names of all `FileNodes` (folders + files) will be converted to full upper case.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  mapFn: (node) => {\n    node.displayName = node.displayName.toUpperCase()\n    return node\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Remove list of elements (`filter`)\n\nUsing this example, you can remove elements from your explorer by providing an array of folders/files to exclude.\nNote that this example filters on the title but you can also do it via slug or any other field available on `FileTrieNode`.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: (node) => {\n    // set containing names of everything you want to filter out\n    const omit = new Set([\"authoring content\", \"tags\", \"advanced\"])\n\n    // can also use node.slug or by anything on node.data\n    // note that node.data is only present for files that exist on disk\n    // (e.g. implicit folder nodes that have no associated index.md)\n    return !omit.has(node.displayName.toLowerCase())\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Remove files by tag\n\nYou can access the tags of a file by `node.data.tags`.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: (node) => {\n    // exclude files with the tag \"explorerexclude\"\n    return node.data?.tags?.includes(\"explorerexclude\") !== true\n  },\n})\n```\n\n### Show every element in explorer\n\nBy default, the explorer will filter out the `tags` folder.\nTo override the default filter function, you can set the filter function to `undefined`.\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  filterFn: undefined, // apply no filter function, every file and folder will visible\n})\n```\n\n## Advanced examples\n\n> [!tip]\n> When writing more complicated functions, the `layout` file can start to look very cramped.\n> You can fix this by defining your sort functions outside of the component\n> and passing it in.\n>\n> ```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\n> import { Options } from \"./quartz/components/Explorer\"\n>\n> export const mapFn: Options[\"mapFn\"] = (node) => {\n>   // implement your function here\n> }\n> export const filterFn: Options[\"filterFn\"] = (node) => {\n>   // implement your function here\n> }\n> export const sortFn: Options[\"sortFn\"] = (a, b) => {\n>   // implement your function here\n> }\n>\n> Component.Explorer({\n>   // ... your other options\n>   mapFn,\n>   filterFn,\n>   sortFn,\n> })\n> ```\n\n### Add emoji prefix\n\nTo add emoji prefixes (📁 for folders, 📄 for files), you could use a map function like this:\n\n```ts title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Explorer({\n  mapFn: (node) => {\n    if (node.isFolder) {\n      node.displayName = \"📁 \" + node.displayName\n    } else {\n      node.displayName = \"📄 \" + node.displayName\n    }\n  },\n})\n```\n","tags":["component","navigation"]},"content/features/folder-and-tag-listings":{"slug":"content/features/folder-and-tag-listings","url":"/s/b1623f077c/v6uraq/content/features/folder-and-tag-listings.html","title":"Folder and Tag Listings","content":"---\ntitle: Folder and Tag Listings\ntags:\n  - feature/emitter\n---\n\nQuartz emits listing pages for any folders and tags you have.\n\n## Folder Listings\n\nQuartz will generate an index page for all the pages under that folder. This includes any content that is multiple levels deep.\n\nAdditionally, Quartz will also generate pages for subfolders. Say you have a note in a nested folder `content/abc/def/note.md`. Then Quartz would generate a page for all the notes under `abc` _and_ a page for all the notes under `abc/def`.\n\nYou can link to the folder listing by referencing its name, plus a trailing slash, like this: `[[advanced/]]` (results in [[advanced/]]).\n\nBy default, Quartz will title the page `Folder: <folder name>` and no description. You can override this by creating an `index.md` file in the folder with the `title` [[authoring content#Syntax|frontmatter]] field. Any content you write in this file will also be used in the folder description.\n\nFor example, for the folder `content/posts`, you can add another file `content/posts/index.md` to add a specific description for it.\n\n## Tag Listings\n\nQuartz will also create an index page for each unique tag in your vault and render a list of all notes with that tag.\n\nQuartz also supports tag hierarchies as well (e.g. `plugin/emitter`) and will also render a separate tag page for each level of the tag hierarchy. It will also create a default global tag index page at `/tags` that displays a list of all the tags in your Quartz.\n\nYou can link to the tag listing by referencing its name with a `tag/` prefix, like this: `[[tags/plugin]]` (results in [[tags/plugin]]).\n\nAs with folder listings, you can also provide a description and title for a tag page by creating a file for each tag. For example, if you wanted to create a custom description for the #component tag, you would create a file at `content/tags/component.md` with a title and description.\n\n## Customization\n\nQuartz allows you to define a custom sort ordering for content on both page types. The folder listings are a functionality of the [[FolderPage]] plugin, the tag listings of the [[TagPage]] plugin. See the plugin pages for customization options.\n","tags":["feature/emitter"]},"content/features/full-text-search":{"slug":"content/features/full-text-search","url":"/s/b1623f077c/v6uraq/content/features/full-text-search.html","title":"Full-text Search","content":"---\ntitle: Full-text Search\ntags:\n  - component\n---\n\nFull-text search in Quartz is powered by [Flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch).

The top 5 search results are shown on each query. Matching subterms are highlighted and the most relevant 30 words are excerpted. Clicking on a search result will navigate to that page.\n\nTo search content by tags, you can either press `⌘`/`ctrl` + `shift` + `K` or start your query with `#` (e.g. `#components`).\n\nThis component is also keyboard accessible: Tab and Shift+Tab will cycle forward and backward through search results and Enter will navigate to the highlighted result (first result by default).

It shows _all_ the notes in your graph and how they connect to each other.\n\nBy default, the node radius is proportional to the total number of incoming and outgoing internal links from that file.\n\nAdditionally, similar to how browsers highlight visited links a different colour, the graph view will also show nodes that you have visited in a different colour.\n\n> [!info]\n> Graph View requires the `ContentIndex` emitter plugin to be present in the [[configuration]].\n\n## Customization\n\nMost configuration can be done by passing in options to `Component.Graph()`.\n\nFor example, here's what the default configuration looks like:\n\n```typescript title=\"quartz.layout.ts\"\nComponent.Graph({\n  localGraph: {\n    drag: true, // whether to allow panning the view around\n    zoom: true, // whether to allow zooming in and out\n    depth: 1, // how many hops of notes to display\n    scale: 1.1, // default view scale\n    repelForce: 0.5, // how much nodes should repel each other\n    centerForce: 0.3, // how much force to use when trying to center the nodes\n    linkDistance: 30, // how long should the links be by default?\n    fontSize: 0.6, // what size should the node labels be?\n    opacityScale: 1, // how quickly do we fade out the labels when zooming out?\n    removeTags: [], // what tags to remove from the graph\n    showTags: true, // whether to show tags in the graph\n    enableRadial: false, // whether to constrain the graph, similar to Obsidian\n  },\n  globalGraph: {\n    drag: true,\n    zoom: true,\n    depth: -1,\n    scale: 0.9,\n    repelForce: 0.5,\n    centerForce: 0.3,\n    linkDistance: 30,\n    fontSize: 0.6,\n    opacityScale: 1,\n    removeTags: [], // what tags to remove from the graph\n    showTags: true, // whether to show tags in the graph\n    enableRadial: true, // whether to constrain the graph, similar to Obsidian\n  },\n})\n```\n\nWhen passing in your own options, you can omit any or all of these fields if you'd like to keep the default value for that field.\n\nWant to customize it even more?\n\n- Removing graph view: delete all usages of `Component.Graph()` from `quartz.layout.ts`.\n- Component: `quartz/components/Graph.tsx`\n- Style: `quartz/components/styles/graph.scss`\n- Script: `quartz/components/scripts/graph.inline.ts`\n","tags":["component"]},"content/features/i18n":{"slug":"content/features/i18n","url":"/s/b1623f077c/v6uraq/content/features/i18n.html","title":"Internationalization","content":"---\ntitle: Internationalization\n---\n\nInternationalization allows users to translate text in the Quartz interface into various supported languages without needing to make extensive code changes.

Even as the scope of Quartz has widened over time, it hasn't lost the ability to seamlessly interoperate with Obsidian.\n\nBy default, Quartz ships with the [[ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown]] plugin, which is a transformer plugin that adds support for [Obsidian Flavored Markdown](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Obsidian+Flavored+Markdown). This includes support for features like [[wikilinks]] and [[Mermaid diagrams]].\n\nIt also ships with support for [frontmatter parsing](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) with the same fields that Obsidian uses through the [[Frontmatter]] transformer plugin.\n\nFinally, Quartz also provides [[CrawlLinks]] plugin, which allows you to customize Quartz's link resolution behaviour to match Obsidian.\n\n## Configuration\n\nThis functionality is provided by the [[ObsidianFlavoredMarkdown]], [[Frontmatter]] and [[CrawlLinks]] plugins. See the plugin pages for customization options.\n","tags":["feature/transformer"]},"content/features/popover-previews":{"slug":"content/features/popover-previews","url":"/s/b1623f077c/v6uraq/content/features/popover-previews.html","title":"Popover Previews","content":"---\ntitle: Popover Previews\n---\n\nLike Wikipedia, when you hover over a link in Quartz, there is a popup of a page preview that you can scroll to see the entire content. Links to headers will also scroll the popup to show that specific header in view.\n\nBy default, Quartz only fetches previews for pages inside your vault due to [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS). It does this by selecting all HTML elements with the `popover-hint` class. For most pages, this includes the page title, page metadata like words and time to read, tags, and the actual page content.\n\nWhen [[creating components|creating your own components]], you can include this `popover-hint` class to also include it in the popover.\n\nSimilar to Obsidian, [[quartz-layout-desktop.png|images referenced using wikilinks]] can also be viewed as popups.\n\n## Configuration\n\n- Remove popovers: set the `enablePopovers` field in `quartz.config.ts` to be `false`.\n- Style: `quartz/components/styles/popover.scss`\n- Script: `quartz/components/scripts/popover.inline.ts`\n","tags":[]},"content/features/reader-mode":{"slug":"content/features/reader-mode","url":"/s/b1623f077c/v6uraq/content/features/reader-mode.html","title":"Reader Mode","content":"---\ntitle: Reader Mode\ntags:\n  - component\n---\n\nReader Mode is a feature that allows users to focus on the content by hiding the sidebars and other UI elements. When enabled, it provides a clean, distraction-free reading experience.\n\n## Configuration\n\nReader Mode is enabled by default. To disable it, you can remove the component from your layout configuration in `quartz.layout.ts`:\n\n```ts\n// Remove or comment out this line\nComponent.ReaderMode(),\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Reader Mode toggle appears as a button with a book icon. When clicked:\n\n- Sidebars are hidden\n- Hovering over the content area reveals the sidebars temporarily\n\nUnlike Dark Mode, Reader Mode state is not persisted between page reloads but is maintained during SPA navigation within the site.\n\n## Customization\n\nYou can customize the appearance of Reader Mode through CSS variables and styles. The component uses the following classes:\n\n- `.readermode`: The toggle button\n- `.readerIcon`: The book icon\n- `[reader-mode=\"on\"]`: Applied to the root element when Reader Mode is active\n\nExample customization in your custom CSS:\n\n```scss\n.readermode {\n  // Customize the button\n  svg {\n    stroke: var(--custom-color);\n  }\n}\n```\n","tags":["component"]},"content/features/table-of-contents":{"slug":"content/features/table-of-contents","url":"/s/b1623f077c/v6uraq/content/features/table-of-contents.html","title":"Table of Contents","content":"---\ntitle: \"Table of Contents\"\ntags:\n  - component\n  - feature/transformer\n---\n\nQuartz can automatically generate a table of contents (TOC) from a list of headings on each page.

See the plugin page for more customization options.\n\nIt also needs the `TableOfContents` component, which is displayed in the right sidebar by default. You can change this by customizing the [[layout]].
